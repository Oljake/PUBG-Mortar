# PUBG Mortar Calculator

A simple GUI application built with `customtkinter` to calculate the hypotenuse (c) using the Pythagorean theorem. The application helps determine the optimal mortar distance in PUBG.

## Features
- Accepts two numerical inputs (`a` and `b`).
- Calculates the hypotenuse (`c = sqrt(a² + b²)`).
- Provides feedback on whether the distance is too close, too far, or optimal.
- Clears input fields and refocuses after calculation.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.7+ recommended). You also need `customtkinter`, which can be installed using:
```sh
pip install customtkinter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```sh

cd pubg-mortar-calculator
```
2. Run the script:
```sh

```
3. Enter values for `a` and `b`, then press `Enter` or click "Calculate".
